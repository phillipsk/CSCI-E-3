      <p class="whatlearn">Unit 3 Projects will cover the DOM, browser Events
        and FORM handling, with a detour into Javascript closures.This part (a)
        will focus on the DOM.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3 class="whatlearn">What you're learning:</h3>
      <p>Javascript is the "behavior" layer of the client-side Web experience.
        This unit covers some of the common interactions between the components
        of a Web page (structure, content, styles, forms) and Javascript, as
        exposed by the DOM and the DOM Event model. <br>
      </p>

          <li>DOM Exercise: Split a block of text into individual SPANs or DIVs</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <h4>1) DOM Exercise: Split a block of text into individual SPANs or DIVs</h4>
      <p>The following exercise contains a block of text that represents the
        written transcript of a video. Often, a transcript is provided with a
        video so viewers can read along, or so the video can be captioned.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>In this exercise, we'll be doing the first step in building an
        interface that could appear alongside a video player on a Web
        page.&nbsp; The idea is that each word in the transcript will highlight
        as the matching portion of the video is playing.</p>
      <p>In order to do this, each word must be in its own HTML SPAN (or DIV).
        In a real video transcript application, each SPAN would have a time
        value in seconds associated with it, and as that moment of the video
        played, we'd change the background color of the SPAN matching that time
        period. </p>
      <p> In a real application, we would also have the word be clickable, upon
        which the video would seek to the appropriate moment and play from
        there.&nbsp; We will do this in Unit 4 if this course, but you don't
        have to make the words clickable in this assignment.&nbsp; Instead,
        you'll make the words highlight (with a yellow background perhaps, or
        some other notable change in style) when the mouse is over the word. </p>
      <p>So, if the input text is <strong>Breaking News. Spring is here to
          stay.</strong> the HTML output would be something like:</p>
      <code>&lt;span class="word" id="word0"&gt;Breaking &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word1"&gt;News. &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word2"&gt;Spring &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word3"&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word4"&gt;here &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word5"&gt;to &lt;/span&gt;<br>
        &lt;span class="word" id="word6"&gt;stay. &lt;/span&gt;</code>
      <p>In practice, the display of the sentence in the browser wouldn't look
        much different, like so: <b><span class="word" id="word0">Breaking </span>
          <span class="word" id="word1">News. </span> <span class="word" id="word2">Spring
            </span> <span class="word" id="word3">is </span> <span class="word"
            id="word4">here </span> <span class="word" id="word5">to </span>
          <span class="word" id="word6">stay.&nbsp; </span></b>(go ahead and
        View Source and you'll see that this sentence in this paragraph is
        indeed separated into seven distinct SPANs).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We won't be building the video player part of this tool in this
        exercise. We'll only be preparing the transcript by dividing it into
        individual SPANs. </p>
      <p>The DIV that will serve as your input (and output) is here, with
        id="transcriptText":</p>
      <div id="transcriptText"> It’s that time of year when you clean out your
        closets, dust off shelves, and spruce up your floors. Once you’ve taken
        care of the dust and dirt, what about some digital cleaning? Going
        through all your files and computers may seem like a daunting task, but
        we found ways to make the process fairly painless.</div>
      <br>
      <button id="divideTranscript" class="button">&nbsp;Transform the
        Transcript!&nbsp; </button>
      <br>
      <p>Your task is to add Javascript to the file js/hw3a.js that will convert
        that text as described when the <em>Transform the Transcript</em>
        button is clicked. Your output can be written back into the same DIV.&nbsp;
        You may use innerHTML to clear the contents of the DIV, but not to
        create the SPAN elements.&nbsp; You should build the elements using
        document.createElement() and the associated methods.</p>
      <p>To break the problem into smaller pieces, you may want to think about
        it as a few simple steps that may look something like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Divide the text into an array of words.</li>
        <li>Iterate over that array, at each step:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Build SPAN elements as you go, along with the attributes as shown
            in the example</li>
          <li>Add the SPAN elements to the original DIV</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Add a handler to the SPAN elements, or to the DIV, which causes the
          style on the SPAN to change on mouseover. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Submit your solution as a ZIP file, with the usual naming convention: a
        folder named [lastname_firstname]_project3a zipped into a file named like
        [lastname_firstname]_project3a.zip</p>
