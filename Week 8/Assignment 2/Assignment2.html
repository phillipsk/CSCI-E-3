<h3>Practice Set #2, Week 8, Modifying the DOM</h3>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Assignment2.css">
<p>We're going to practice the steps of manually creating an adding a DOM element to a page. To do this, we'll create a DIV with id="myNewDiv" that contains some text, and attach it to the div already on this page with id="addNewOneHere". If you've done it right, it will appear with a red background.</p>
<p>Hint: There's five steps here, as shown in the lessons, particularly lesson 3 section 2, the TOC example in Video 8.6, and the <a href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/modifying-document#creating-elements" target="blank">readings on javascript.info</a>. You'll have to:
<ol>
    <li>create a 'DIV' element node and assign it to a variable</li>
    <li>using setAttribute(), give it an ID attribute of "myNewDiv"</li>
    <li>create a text node with some text of your choosing, and assign it to a variable</li>
    <li>append you text node to your element</li>
    <li>append your new element to the existing div which has id="addNewOneHere"</li>
</ol>
</p>
<div id="addNewOneHere">This is the div where you'll add your new element using Javascript.  </div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="Assignment2.js"></script>
