<h3>Practice Set, Week 9, Event Handling and Bubbling</h3>

<p>This page contains two buttons, each with an event handler that causes the button, when clicked to echo its text to the page.</p>
<p>Your task is to rewrite the event handling code so that there is only one event handling function. That function should be called when a user clicks on <i>either</i> button. The output should remain identical. </p>
<p>You'll want to consider attaching a single event handler to a node further up the DOM tree, and checking there for which element was actually clicked (using a conditional). </p>
<p>Hint: this is exactly the process that's demonstrated in the video in Week 9 Lesson 2</p>
