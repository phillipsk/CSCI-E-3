<h3>Basic Math and String Operations</h3>
<h4>4 Tasks for this Practice Set:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Write a script to add two numbers and output the sum to the console</li><li>
    Write a script that prompts for input, adds one to whatever number was input and outputs the sum to the console. Use the increment operator.  Assume that the input will be a number (no type-checking is required for this exercise).
</li><li>
    Look up the Math object, and use one of its methods to do <i>something</i> to a number and output the result to the console (you pick: square it, round a decimal number up or down, do a trig function...whatever) Make sure the you comment your code or use console output to describe what you’re doing.
</li><li>
    Prompt for input and assign the result to a variable. Then, look up the String object, and use one of its properties to output the length of the string variable to the console.
</li>
