<p>This practice problem is designed to help make you comfortable with working with an object's properties - creating them, referencing them, and iterating over them.  There are two parts to this practice problem.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add two keys and values to this object. You can make them anything you like: title, shoe size, height and weight...whatever. You may also change the values provided if you prefer, so that this object describes anyone you like.</li>
    <li>Add code to this example that will iterate over this object's properties and write each property name and its value using the logMessage() function provided.  Remember that in the lesson, we talked about the <br/><code>for (key in object){}</code> looping technique. </li>
    <p><b>Output:</b>
